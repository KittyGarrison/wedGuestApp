    <p>October 2009 Marcus started attending and submitting work to art shows in Detroit. He was accepted by 2 shows scheduled the same week. Halloween was just around the corner. Marcus found himself right in the middle of a full crowd at Bert's Warehouse for Detroit's Annual Erotica ball. Everyone was entertained by all the art, and dancing ladies. One in particular stole Marcus' attention with an electric performance. As it ended, the ladies made their way through the crowd. She was walking right towards him, turning heads with every step. Some liquid courage made their introduction a little easier, but every bit bizarre. Little did either know that this was the 1st of 3 occasions where they would meet over the next week, by chance.  A couple days later, they met at an open mic, and at another the next night. The following day they saw each other again during the DAMNED Exhibition at the Tangent Gallery, and escorted each other to the last evening of the show. This would eventually become the place where Marcus would propose to Kitty, on their 5th year together, on their favorite holiday, at their favorite venue. </p>
